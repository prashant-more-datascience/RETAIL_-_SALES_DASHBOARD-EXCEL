# RETAIL_-_SALES_DASHBOARD

 Problem Statement
Retail companies face challenges in understanding customer behavior, optimizing regional sales strategies, and addressing operational inefficiencies such as delays in issue resolution. Without a centralized, data-driven system, decision-makers struggle to identify top-performing products, regions, and customer segments, leading to missed growth opportunities and poor customer satisfaction.

Project Description
The Retail Customer & Sales Insights Dashboard is an interactive data visualization tool designed to provide a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer activity, product performance, regional sales, and operational metrics.

This dashboard enables stakeholders to:

Track monthly revenue growth and identify sales peaks and slumps.

Monitor average resolution times across regions to assess customer service performance.

Analyze regional sales distribution and average order amounts to tailor regional strategies.

View product category performance in terms of pricing and popularity.

Highlight the top customers contributing to revenue for targeted loyalty programs.

Evaluate the most common issues faced by customers to improve operational efficiency.

Track new customer acquisition trends and active customer counts by region and time period.

Built with clarity and interactivity in mind, this dashboard assists management in making informed decisions by transforming raw sales and customer data into actionable insights.
